## [HiPerGator](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/about/hipergator/)
The University of Florida supercomputer is a cluster that includes the latest generation of processors and offers nodes for memory-intensive computation. HiPerGatorâ€™s high-performance storage systems can be accessed from diverse interfaces, including Globus, UFApps for Research, and other tools.

UFIT Research Computing maintains the cluster and its many parts, allowing researchers to focus on their research instead of hardware and software maintenance.

HiPerGator workspaces are separated by `groups` to isolate separated projects and teams. Users share the allocated resources in each `group`. Each user has only one primary group but able to have zero or more secondary groups. <br />
IC<sup>3</sup> center has **4** groups right no


## Groups

### `prismap-datatrust` group
The resources are allocated for PrismaP grants and projects. The user group takes charge of PrismaP retrospective datasets and database service. **Data Trust**. 
#### Usage scenarios
* Data Storage

  * Public Database (for data publish, *OMOP*)
* PubApps (web Applications)
  * Data Playbook (Public dataset documentation site)
  * IC<sup>3</sup> ATLAS (Intenal usage only for **Cohort Identification**)

All unstructured data will be saved as flat files while the corresponded metadata will be linked and stored into database. 

:::info Notice
PrismaP team has the plan to provide some data service to other IC<sup>3</sup> members or external teams. A polished business plan will be provided later.
