## [HiPerGator](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/about/hipergator/)
The University of Florida supercomputer is a cluster that includes the latest generation of processors and offers nodes for memory-intensive computation. HiPerGatorâ€™s high-performance storage systems can be accessed from diverse interfaces, including Globus, UFApps for Research, and other tools.

UFIT Research Computing maintains the cluster and its many parts, allowing researchers to focus on their research instead of hardware and software maintenance.

HiPerGator workspaces are separated by `groups` to isolate separated projects. Users share the allocated resources in each `group`. Each user has only one primary group but able to have zero or more secondary groups. <br />
IC<sup>3</sup> center has **2** groups right now.

## Groups

### `uf-iccc` group

#### How to use the resources
