description: Explainable, Fair, Reproducible and Collaborative Medical AI
---

## Project Introduction
The overall objective of this project is to develop a new conceptual framework for **Explainable, Fair, Reproducible, and Collaborative Medical AI** to provide a foundation for clinical implementation at scale. It will leverage the OneFlorida, a large clinical consortium of 22 hospitals serving 10 million patients in Florida, the nationâ€™s third largest state. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. 
* External and prospective validation of novel interpretable, dynamic, actionable, fair and reproducible algorithmic toolkit for real-time surgical risk surveillance. 
* Developing and evaluating explainable AI platform (XAI-IDEALIST) for real-time surgical risk surveillance using human-grounded benchmarks. 
* Implementing and evaluating a federated learning approach with advanced privacy features for collaborative surgical risk model training. 

The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to 
1. Build the first surgical FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) AI-ready, large multicenter multimodal dataset, 
2. Novel computational approaches accompanied by assessing fairness and reproducibility, 
3. A multifaceted and full-stack explainable AI framework, and 
4. Federated learning capacity for privacy-preserving model training across institutions. 

The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers, including 
- lack of AI-ready large surgical datasets, 
- lack of interpretable, dynamic, actionable, fair and reproducible surgical risk algorithms, 
- lack of a medical AI explainability platform, and 
- lack of a systematic approach for collaborative model training and sharing across institutions. 

> ***Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications.***
