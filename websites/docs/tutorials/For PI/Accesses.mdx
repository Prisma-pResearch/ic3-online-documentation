:::warning
Any member who needs to access PHI/restricted data is mandatory to take IRB trainings and added into IRBs before obtaining any accesses.

To consult about IRB issues, please contact [Armfield, Brooke A](mailto:barmfield@ufl.edu) or [Davidson, Andrea](mailto:Andrea.Davidson@medicine.ufl.edu).

## Resources

### Shared folder and Databases
Shared folder and databases are the infrastructures for storage. Both of them are managed by UF Health IT in **restricted UF Health network**.<br />
Shared folder is used to store datasets and in-house developed codes as flat files. <br />
Databases are used to store structed, cleaned data.

#### To obtain the access to shared folder/databases, here is the work flow:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'securityLevel': 'loose', 'theme':'base'}}%%
flowchart LR
start[Requester] --send requests -->judge[IC3 data core]

judge --> judge2{IT requests needed?}

judge2 -- yes -->b[Project Manager]
b --send IT requests--> IT
judge2 -- no --> b2[IC3 data core]
b2 --fulfill requests -->start

```

1. PI needs to send requests to [IC<sup>3</sup> Data Core](mailto:ziyuan.guan@ufl.edu) on behalf of the user.
2. [Wasykowski, Natalie](mailto:Natalie.Wasykowski@medicine.ufl.edu) is the project manager.
3. If the user has IRB issues, please contact [Armfield, Brooke A](mailto:barmfield@ufl.edu) or [Davidson, Andrea](mailto:Andrea.Davidson@medicine.ufl.edu).

### IC<sup>3</sup> GitHub

[IC<sup>3</sup> GitHub](https://github.com/Prisma-pResearch) is private, please contact with [Guan, Ziyuan(Chester)](mailto:ziyuan.guan@ufl.edu) to obtain the access.

### IC<sup>3</sup> Servers
To access servers, PI needs to send requests to [IC<sup>3</sup> System Core](mailto:ziyuan.guan@ufl.edu) on behalf of the team member. <br />
:::tip
There are two ways to access the computational resources: 
:::
#### 1. Create `Jupyter Notebook Server` container for users
This method is suitable for **short-team** projects, OPS students and beginners. **It's the quickest way to get the computational resources currently.**
* **<u>Pros</u>**:
1. No need to send IT tickets to add user into the server.
2. It's easier to control the permissions of the user.
3. Our customized Jupyter notebook docker image has already installed packages for data processing and model training. 
* **<u>Cons</u>**:
1. Users only has the permissions for limited resources and files.
2. Users cannot use docker containers.

> IC<sup>3</sup> System Core manages the `Jupyter Notebook Server` containers.

#### 2. Add user into server
This method is suitable for **long-term** projects, PHD students, data scientists and engineers.
* **<u>Pros</u>**:
1. Direct access to the server and docker container. 
2. Able to create personal environments.
* **<u>Cons</u>**:
1. Need to send IT tickets to add user into the server.
2. User needs to have fundamental knowledge to use Linux command lines.
3. User's casual operations might crash other people's work.

### HiPerGator
:::tip HiPerGator Groups
Currently, IC<sup>3</sup> has **2** HiPerGator groups. 
:::

#### [`uf-iccc` group](/docs/workspaces/HiPerGator#uf-iccc-group)
