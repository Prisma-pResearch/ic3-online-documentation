## Introduction
IC<sup>3</sup> have built and maintained multiple databases to store the **cleaned data**.
With the database, researchers are able to understand the datasets and filter the research sub-cohort easily. 
Our data has two different data models:
- UF IDR(Integrated Data Registry) format
- [OMOP CDM v5.4](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html)
:::tip
In the future, all of data will be in **OMOP CDM**. We are working hard to fully map the Epic data now.

## Instructions
Currently, we have three data servers.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Prod-MySQL" label="Prod-MySQL">

The database schemas are hosted by a MySQL server.<br />
The authentication and authorization of the data server is managed by UF Health IT, to obtain the access to the database, please refer to the instructions [here](/docs/tutorials/For%20PI/Accesses#databases).<br />
To work with the database, we recommend to use [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) software.<br />
- HostPath: mysql07.ahc.ufl.edu
- Port: 3306

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Prod-MSSQL" label="Prod-MSSQL">

The database schemas are hosted by a SQL server.<br />
The authentication and authorization of the data server is managed by UF Health IT, to obtain the access to the database, please refer to the instructions [here](/docs/tutorials/For%20PI/Accesses#databases).<br />
To work with the database, we recommend to use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) software.<br />
- HostPath: ahc-prismapdb.ahc.ufl.edu
- Port: 1433

```py title="databaseConnection.py"
from sqlalchemy import create_engine 
from sqlalchemy.engine import URL 
#highlight-next-line
# build connection with Windows Authentication
connection_string = ( 

    r"Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};"     

    r"Server={AHC-PRISMAPDB.AHC.UFL.EDU};"     

    r"Database={PRISMAP_IDEALIST};"     

    r"Trusted_Connection=yes;" 

) 

connection_url = URL.create( 

    "mssql+pyodbc",  

    query={"odbc_connect": connection_string} 

) 

engine = create_engine(connection_url) 
```

All databases are protected under UF Health restricted network. [UF Health VPN](/docs/tutorials/For%20Members/connectWithUFHealthVPN.mdx) is **necessary** to build the connection.
