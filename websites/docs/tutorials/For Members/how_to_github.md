# Github Tutorial
> Github is a great tool used for version control and codes storage.
> This document is trying to set up a simple standard in applying with Github for IC3 members. 

## Common commands

* [Git and GitHub for beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/)

* [Basic Git commands](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html)

## How to use Github Repository

### Roles and privileges
* Repository admin group (admin)
* Maintainers (write)
* Others (read)

### Operations
* Implement the repository descriptions and indicate the necessary information.
* Commits are supposed to be small and frequent
* Commit messages should be semantic:
  * First line indicate the commit reason
  * Other lines indicate whatt have been altered
* One [Branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches), one feature. All merges must be reviewed and confirmed by admin.
* Create [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) for recording bug fixing and other problems.   
* Create [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to merge with main branch. Repository admin should review the merge. 
* Submit [Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) refer to project's progress. Repository admin should set up the release plan. 
* Look into [Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), submodules are useful to create clean repository when multiple related respositories are included.

## How to use Github Project(beta)
[Github Project(beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) is a new feature developed by Github for planning and tracking work on GitHub, especially good for new projects.

There are two use cases here :
1. Create the task board for **each IC3 Core**, core manager could assign, track, monitor tasks for the core members. Core manager could also make justifications of jobs based on the progress and evaluate the core memebers in a clear and better method.
   
2. Create the phrases board for **new project**. Project manager could separate the new project into several phrases, and assign expected tasks and deadlines.It will be benefical to monitor the whole project progress.

## How to use Github Project(classic)
[Github Project(classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards) is also named as 'Project(board)'. Project boards helps organize and prioritize jobs. We could create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. 

> [!TIP]
> We recommend to create the project(board) for old/existed project to assign new jobs or fix issues. <u>The feature should be replaced soon with Projects(beta)</u>.
