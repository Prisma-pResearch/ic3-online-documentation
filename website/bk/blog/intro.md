# Documentation Tutorial

![image](/img/ufAI.jpg)
## Introduction
This online documentation service consists mainly with two parts:
- Docs
- Blog

In `Docs`, we organized our knowledge and experience about projects, datasets and technical issues in separated folders. 
* Featured Projects - covers the information of the projects and grants.
* Datasets - covers the information about various datasets and data dictionaries.
* Workspaces - covers the information about computional resources we have.
* Tutorials - covers the answers and workflows for general issues.

The documentation is like an e-book, and you can easily find your answers here. 

In `Blog`, we plan to invite our researchers to write some brief but inspiring articles to introduce their **research and innovative discoveries**.
